# VR-Tivoli

During my studies at University of Agder, I took a course (MM-505) Virtual and Augmented reality in the year 2020.
In this course I learned the basics within both Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.

While learning about Virtual Reality, I was challenged to create a VR game, and I created VR Tivoli.
VR Tivoli, in this VR game you will meet a few mini games that could be commonly found in Tivoly or fun/theme parks.
The player is met with a few mini game challenges, for example: 
Hit the rabbit, a game where you have a hammer and a box with holes on top. The rabbit pops up at a random hole, and the goal is to hit the rabbit with the hammer.
